# QOA - The “Quite OK Audio Format” for fast, lossy audio compression

See [qoa.h](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoa/blob/master/qoa.h) for
the documentation and format specification.

More info at: https://qoaformat.org.

Audio samples in WAV & QOA format can be found at: [Samples](https://qoaformat.org/samples/).

This is a modest project/exercise I tackled during my internship to familiarize myself with the programming language Ada. It's an audio file converter (WAV -> QOA) for the Qoa format created by Dominic Szablewski at [phoboslab.org](https://phoboslab.org/).
